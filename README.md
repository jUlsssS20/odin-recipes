The website is my first project in HTML. The project is just mainly structure with minimal formatting and styling, just vanilla HTML code.

The website consists of a main index page which have links to three recipes: Zucchini Spaghetti, Chicken Makhani, and Persian Rice. Each recipe has time properties, images, ingredients, and procedures.

The project was fairly easy to structure as it only contained the basics of HTML code, There was barely any critical thinking needed, just purely on making the website structure as neat as possible. Looking forward to CSS.
