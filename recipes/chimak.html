    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken makhani, more commonly known as butter chicken, is a rich and creamy North Indian dish that originated in Delhi in the mid-20th century. It is made with marinated pieces of chicken—often cooked in a tandoor—that are simmered in a smooth tomato-based sauce enriched with butter, cream, and aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, and coriander. The result is a mildly spiced curry with a velvety texture and a balance of savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
        This dish is widely celebrated for its versatility and appeal, often served with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice. While traditional recipes use charcoal or clay oven cooking for the chicken, modern versions adapt to stovetops or ovens without losing the signature taste. Chicken makhani has become a global favorite, appearing on menus far beyond India, prized for its comforting, indulgent character and ability to satisfy both spice lovers and those who prefer milder curries.
